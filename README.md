# Name of Project:

    Homework Task 7
    Part Names: (1) ERD.png   (3) Diagram_Code.SQL   (3) Table_Schemata.SQL   (4)  Solutions.SQL   (5) Bonus_Section.ipymb

# Description:

	In this project I have written scripts which, to my knowledge, satisfy every section of the five tasks. 
	See screen captures 1 - 11 which I have uploaded to this repository. They show main features that we were required to create.
    There are also PNG files showing the two graphs from the Bonus section.

# Activation of a script:

    (1) Locate the scripts by opening the folder in the GitLab repository called Employees_SQL. 
 
	(2) Run the scripts in the order that they appear.

    (3) Please be aware that in the Solutions.SQL file I have written some additional code which verifies my answers.

I would like to acknowledge the work of our instructor, Akash, who helped me to adjust my schemata when the 'employees' CSV file would not import.
